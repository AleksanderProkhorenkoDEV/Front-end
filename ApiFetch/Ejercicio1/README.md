# Api Fetch

This exercise involves two buttons in which if you click on the DOG button, using fetch we get the image of a random dog, and on the cat button we do the same but with a cat.

For the cat one to work for you, you will have to register and they will send you a Key to your GMAIL, that is what you will have to use to access the photos
